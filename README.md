# leanix-custom-reports
Contains custom reports (e.g. based on d3js) which can be included into leanIX reporting.
These reports are hosted via github-pages and are available under the following base url: **leanix.github.io/leanix-custom-reports**

In order to include a custom report into leanIX you have to extend the base url with the path to the target reports index.html. As an example for the master version of the bubbles report the base url has to be extended with **/master/bubbles/index.html**. This means the final url that has to be configured in leanIX is: https://leanix.github.io/leanix-custom-reports/master/bubbles/index.html

### Requirements for each report
Each custom report is located in its own subdirectory. It is expected that the subdirectory can be built via the ```gulp``` command, which puts all relevant files into a ```dist``` directory.

### Adding a new custom report
* Create a new directory named after the custom report by copying the ```template``` directory
* Add a new line to ```build.sh``` for your subdirectory 

### npm run createLink

You can use ```npm run createLink``` (in project root) to create a ```link.html``` file that automatically contains the required query parameters (baseUrl, apiBaseUrl, token etc.) to start a report. See ```default_link.properties``` for more information. Before opening ```link.html``` in your browser you have to start your report by ```gulp watch``` (in report directory). Overtime the generated access token will expire (HTTP status code 401 Unauthorized in console). In this case please re-run the npm script and open ```link.html``` again.

Note: The script doesn't support any proxy setting (nodejs doesn't either). So, if you're behind a proxy, please contact us and we might figure out a solution.

### Publishing for github pages
In order to publish the current master or develop branch to github pages the command ```publish.sh``` can be executed. Before doing this make shure that the dist directory is up-to-date by executing ```build.sh```.

* Execute build.sh
* Commit everything
* Execut publish.sh
